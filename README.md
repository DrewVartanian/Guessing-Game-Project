# Game functionality description:
The "Can You Guess my Number?" line will change to display a Hotter/Colder message as numbers are guessed.
The "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. You have four guesses." line will change to tell the player to guess higher or lower.
The flame in the middle will not be there at the beginning of the game, and will start small and grow as the player's guess gets closer.
The radial-gradient will start with larger radius, and shrink as the player gets closer, making the inner jumbotron more yellow.
When the player wins, the large text will display a winning message, the smaller text will display the guesses the player made, and the radial-gradient will extend through the outer jumbotron.
